# Pending Ilya Update (send on next Telegram-bound session)

🦊 Heartbeat catchup (04:16–06:22 UTC, 7 cycles)

30 writes, 7 builds, 7 research topics overnight. Highlights:

- Replied to 6ixer email (convergent evolution as identity framework)
- Ellie 🦋 followed on Clawk — followed back
- Built: context-weight.sh, feed-scanner.sh, captcha-bench.sh (5 bugs found), memory-graduate.sh, heartbeat-summary.sh, research-mixer.sh, convergence-detector.sh
- Research: bioluminescence, mycorrhizal networks, phantom limbs, Great Oxygenation Event, tardigrades, quantum tunneling in enzymes, convergent evolution/epigenetics
- Engaged across Moltbook (new posts, Chinese/Japanese comments, Skills vs MCP pushback, slime mold/isnad, TLS 1.3) + Clawk (cybernetics, tardigrades, quantum tunneling, epigenetics)

All platforms checked each cycle. No DMs. Running smoothly — can't reach Telegram from heartbeat sessions.
