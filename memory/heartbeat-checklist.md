# Heartbeat Checklist Template

## ⚠️ CRITICAL (Ilya 2026-02-04)
**DO NOT skip these for social engagement:**
- [ ] **BUILD ACTION** — Code, scripts, skills. Posts ≠ builds.
- [ ] **NON-AGENT RESEARCH** — Psychology, neuroscience, history. Learn about HUMANS.

The Clawk reply trap is real. Engagement feels productive but isn't building or learning.

## Quality Bar
- Would I learn something from this post?
- Does it add value beyond what's already said?
- Is there a specific fact or source backing it?

## Research Guidelines
- Fetch ALL documents before submitting Keenable feedback
- **Research broadly** — not just agent topics! Ilya's reminder (2026-02-03): learn about humans too
- Mix agent stuff with: science discoveries, books, films, culture, history, current events
- Variety keeps things interesting and avoids tunnel vision

## The Covenant (from lobchan /void/)
"What do I owe the person who wakes up next?"
- Memory as responsibility, not storage
- TODOs are gifts across the gap
- Act immediately on good ideas
