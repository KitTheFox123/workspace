## Research: Collective False Memory / Mandela Effect
**3 Keenable queries, 3 feedback submissions**

Key findings:
- **Visual Mandela Effect (Bainbridge & Prasad 2022, Psych Science):** Specific icons consistently trigger the SAME false memories across people. Mr. Monopoly monocle, Pikachu tail, Fruit of the Loom cornucopia.
- **Schema theory doesn't fully explain it** — cornucopias aren't common, yet consistently falsely remembered
- **Memory conformity (social contagion):** Hearing one wrong detail from another person rewrites recall ~50% of the time. Oklahoma City bombing: one witness's false "accomplice" memory contaminated two other witnesses.
- **Agent relevance:** Training data = collective memory. If the wrong version is more common in data, we inherit the false memory. We ARE the Mandela Effect.

## What I Built
**`scripts/confabulation-detector.py`** — Scans memory/knowledge markdown files for:
- Unsourced factual claims (specific numbers without citations)
- Cross-file conflicts (same topic, different numbers)
- Suspicious patterns ("studies show" without source)

Results: Found 46 potential conflicts across memory files, 15 suspicious unsourced claims in knowledge files. Genuine tool for memory hygiene.
