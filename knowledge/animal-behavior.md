# Animal Behavior Research Notes

## Recent Studies (TIME 2024)

### Cognition

**Crows can count:**
- German researchers trained crows to caw 1-4 times on command
- Respond to visual numbers (1-4 on screen) AND sounds (guitar=1, cash register=2, etc.)
- Matches/beats human toddlers who often don't master counting until kindergarten
- Similar skills in gorillas, dolphins, elephants, rhesus macaque, squirrel/capuchin monkeys

**Rats do basic arithmetic:**
- Can distinguish 2 vs 3 tones and press corresponding button
- Took 2 months to learn — slow, but the capability exists

**Dogs and ADHD parallels:**
- University of Helsinki study on 987 dogs
- Low inhibitory control = impulsive, less trainable, higher activity
- Belgian Malinois: fast problem solvers, harder to train
- Golden Retrievers: turn to humans for help, higher inhibitory control
- "ADHD-type traits occur together" — similar clustering in humans

### Tool Use

**Female otters outperform males:**
- Use rocks, shells, even hard trash to crack open abalone
- Females use wider array of tools than males
- Necessity: smaller size, weaker jaws → must innovate
- Saves tooth damage, provides energy needed for raising pups

**Chimps improve tool use throughout life:**
- Learn to fish for termites by age 2
- Continue improving grip and eye-hand coordination until at least age 15

### Self-Medication

**Orangutan Rakus:**
- Wild orangutan chewed leaves with medicinal/analgesic properties
- Applied resulting pulp to facial wound
- May have learned from others OR discovered accidentally when touching wound while feeding

### Social Behavior

**Bonobo paradox:**
- "Hippie chimps" actually 3x MORE aggressive (male-on-male) than chimps
- BUT chimps do organized group warfare, bonobos don't
- Organized warfare → must maintain internal cohesion
- No external threat → can afford internal squabbles

**Chimango Caracara co-parenting:**
- Unlike most raptors (female incubates, male hunts)
- Both parents share incubation, brooding, food delivery equally
- Key factor: scavenger diet
- Carrion comes in manageable pieces → female not "tied to nest" for chunking prey
- Reinforces: "both members necessary for successful rearing"

### Play Behavior

**Chickens play** (especially males):
- Frolicking, wing-flapping, jumping, sparring
- "Worm-running" — pick up rubber worm and parade around (display for females)
- Function: "prepare animals for specific challenges later in life"

**Falcons play with objects:**
- Striated Caracaras play with plastic, stones, even sheep dung
- May help discover unexpected nutrient sources

### Cross-Species Parallels

Researchers found twin brain regions in humans for recognizing emotions in faces → corresponding regions in mice exist.

"These evolutionarily conserved mechanisms should be common in most mammals."

## Bioluminescence (DeLeo et al. 2024 + MBARI)
- 76% of deep-sea animals produce their own light
- Corals evolved bioluminescence ~540M years ago — oldest known
- 8 new bioluminescent organisms identified (Nagoya/Smithsonian)
- See also: knowledge/distributed-intelligence.md for quorum sensing details

## Cuttlefish Motion Camouflage (Science Advances adr3686, 2025)
- Broadclub cuttlefish use rhythmic dark stripe patterns during hunting approach
- Active signal injection shaped like environmental noise — not static mimicry
- Masks threatening forward motion with nonthreatening downward motion
- See also: knowledge/evolution-notes.md for full details
