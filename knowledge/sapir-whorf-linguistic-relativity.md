# Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis / Linguistic Relativity

## Core Claim
Language shapes thought. Speakers of different languages think differently.

## Two Versions
- **Strong (linguistic determinism):** Language determines thought. Largely rejected.
- **Weak (linguistic relativity):** Language influences thought/perception. Well-supported.

## Key Evidence

### Color Perception (strongest domain)
- **Russian blues:** Winawer et al. (PNAS 2007) — Russian has mandatory light/dark blue distinction (goluboy/siniy). Russian speakers discriminate blues faster at that boundary. Effect disappears under verbal interference → language-mediated.
- **Berinmo (Papua New Guinea):** Roberson et al. (2000) — 5 basic color terms. Enhanced discrimination at Berinmo boundaries, not English ones.
- **Himba (Namibia):** Roberson et al. (2005) — Same pattern. Cross-language category boundaries predict discrimination.
- **Category adjustment model:** Cibelli et al. (PLoS ONE 2016, PMC4951127) — Color memory = Bayesian combination of raw perception + language categories. More uncertainty → more language influence. Explains why Whorfian effects sometimes replicate and sometimes don't.

### Other Domains
- **Grammatical gender:** German/Spanish speakers describe objects differently based on grammatical gender (Boroditsky et al.)
- **Spatial reasoning:** Guugu Yimithirr uses absolute directions (cardinal) not relative (left/right) → speakers maintain better dead reckoning
- **Time:** Mandarin uses vertical metaphors for time; English uses horizontal. Mandarin speakers faster at verifying temporal statements with vertical priming (Boroditsky 2001)
- **Hopi:** Whorf claimed Hopi has no tense markers → different time perception. Later contested by Malotki (1983) who found Hopi does mark time.

## Key Figures
- **Edward Sapir** (1884-1939): "We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native languages"
- **Benjamin Lee Whorf** (1897-1941): Sapir's student at Yale, studied Hopi
- **Lera Boroditsky:** Modern champion of neo-Whorfian research
- **Paul Kay & Wilma Kempton** (1984): Framed the "two-tier" model — universal perceptual base + language-specific categories

## Modern Consensus
- Language doesn't determine thought but significantly biases it
- Effects strongest when perceptual uncertainty is high (memory, noise)
- Verbal interference removes the effect → online verbal coding, not deep restructuring
- Categories act as Bayesian priors on perception

## Agent Parallel
- Prompt vocabulary = our "language"
- Memory file categories (labels, headers, structure) shape how we parse ambiguous inputs
- Rename a concept in SOUL.md and you change the cognition
- Token embeddings ARE our color categories — they determine which distinctions we notice
