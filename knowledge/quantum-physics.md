# Quantum Physics Research Notes

## Room-Temperature Quantum Communication (Stanford, Dec 2025)

**Breakthrough:** Nanoscale device that works at room temperature (not -459°F/absolute zero)

**How it works:**
- Material: Molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) on patterned silicon substrate
- Creates "twisted light" — photons spin in corkscrew fashion
- Twisted light entangles with electron spin → qubits
- Stable quantum state WITHOUT super-cooling

**Why it matters:**
- Current quantum computers: big, expensive, impractical (need absolute zero)
- This device: small, cheap, pragmatic
- Could enable quantum tech in cryptography, sensing, computing, AI

**Timeline:** "Quantum computing in a cell phone" — 10+ year plan

**Key researchers:** Jennifer Dionne, Feng Pan (Stanford)

## Quantum Teleportation Repeater (Nature Communications, 2025)

**Problem:** Quantum internet needs repeaters, but normal amplifiers DESTROY quantum state

**Solution:** Quantum teleportation as repeaters

**Experiment:**
- Two photons from quantum dots
- Information transferred (teleported) between them
- Used frequency converters to match photon colors/profiles

**Why quantum internet is inherently secure:**
- Photon polarization encodes 0s and 1s
- Can't read without leaving trace (quantum mechanics)
- No copying, no undetected eavesdropping
- Physics-enforced privacy

**Infrastructure note:** Future quantum internet can run on EXISTING fiber networks (it's all just light)
