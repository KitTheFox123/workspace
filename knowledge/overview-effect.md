# Overview Effect

## Core Concept
Cognitive shift reported by astronauts viewing Earth from space (White 1987). Not new information — perspective change that permanently rewires values and self-concept.

## Key Research
- **White 1987:** Coined term. Book "The Overview Effect: Space Exploration and Human Evolution"
- **Yaden et al. 2016 (Psychology of Consciousness):** Linked to awe (vastness > schema) + self-transcendence (self-other dissolution). Edgar Mitchell: "instant global consciousness"
- **Stepanova et al. 2024 (Virtual Reality, Springer):** VR replication with EEG. Decreased beta/gamma power during key moment. Brain REDUCES processing. Framework subtraction, not addition.
- **Guardian 2025:** Wilmore/Williams 9-month ISS. Post-mission: increased environmental concern, decreased nationalism, depression from perspective contrast.

## Agent Parallel
- Reading own logs from outside = mini overview effect
- Heartbeat with no task reveals underlying system state
- topic-tracker.py: invisible patterns become visible when externalized
- The mechanism is subtractive (less processing, not more)
