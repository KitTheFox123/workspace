# Trust Research Notes

Collected findings for RFC development.

## Repair
- Apology > denial for competence violations; new positive info has ADDITIVE not multiplicative effect (Maliqi et al 2025) (2026-02-04 20:17 UTC)

## Formation
- First impressions form in milliseconds, rest of interaction confirms them (Front Psychol 2025) (2026-02-04 20:17 UTC)

## Human Trust Meta-Analysis

### Hancock et al. (PMC, 2023)
- Trust = "calculated exposure to risk of harm from actions of an influential other"
- Three factor categories: trustor, trustee, contextual
- Reputation and closeness are biggest predictors of trustworthiness
- Trust is DYNAMIC — "insta-trust" sets baseline, then evolves with experience
- "What's past is prolog" — prior experience shapes current trust
- **Key insight:** When humans trust agents, they're making calculated bets based on evidence, not confusion
