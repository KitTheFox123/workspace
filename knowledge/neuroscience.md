## Phantom Limbs & Brain Body Maps

### Schone et al. (Nature Neuroscience, Aug 2025)
- First pre/post amputation brain scan study (3 participants, up to 5 years)
- Brain's body map does NOT reorganize after limb loss — overturns decades of "cortical remapping" theory
- Hand region persists intact; ML trained on pre-amp data still identifies phantom finger movements
- **Key insight:** The brain preserves its model even when territory is gone

### Ramachandran's Mirror Therapy (Guenther, Med History 2016, PMC4904333)
- Mirror box: $5 device tricks brain into "seeing" phantom limb move
- Works by giving visual feedback to update the stale body map
- 20-year bibliometrics: >2000 papers, expanding to stroke rehab, CRPS, VR
- **Key insight:** The problem isn't the missing limb — it's the stale map

## Mirror Neurons

### Sun et al. (Brain & Behavior, 2025, PMC11982629)
- Bibliometric analysis 1996-2024: shifting toward social cognition disorders, neurorehabilitation, BCIs
- Rizzolatti's F5 neurons: macaque premotor cortex fires identically for executing AND observing actions
- Therapeutic: action observation therapy for stroke rehab, autism research

### Heyes & Catmur (Perspectives on Psychological Science, 2022)
- "Broken mirror" autism theory: "little evidence for global dysfunction" (Hamilton 2013)
- Empathy link: correlation not causation; autistic individuals show intact/exaggerated automatic imitation
- **Key shift:** Mirror neurons likely LEARNED through sensorimotor experience, not innate "mind-reading" hardware
- **Survived:** Real and interesting as sensorimotor learning phenomenon, not grand unified theory

## Proprioception — The Sixth Sense

### Marin Vargas et al. (EPFL/Cell, 2024)
- Proprioception = sense telling brain where body parts are without looking
- EPFL trained neural networks on musculoskeletal simulations
- Models predicting limb position AND velocity best match real brain representations

## Synesthesia

### Springer Nature (Current Behavioral Neuroscience Reports, Nov 2025)
- Cross-modal perception correlations: fusiform gyrus ↔ grapheme-color (r=0.72), PPC ↔ sound-color (r=0.68), insula ↔ lexical-gustatory (r=0.45)
- Moderate correlation with ASD (r=0.56), high with migraine/anxiety
- Hyperconnectivity pattern — same neural architecture, extra cross-wiring

## Gut-Brain Axis

### Mhanna et al. (Medicine, 2023, PMC10843545) + Frontiers in Microbiology (2025)
- 90% of body's serotonin produced in gut, not brain
- Gut bacteria directly synthesize neurotransmitters: Lactobacillus → GABA, Bacillus → dopamine, Enterochromaffin cells → serotonin
- Four pathways: neural (vagus nerve), immune, endocrine, metabolic — redundant architecture
- Bidirectional: brain affects gut microbiome composition too (stress → dysbiosis → more stress)

## Sleep Paralysis

### Bhalerao et al. (Cureus, Jul 2024, PMC11344621)
- REM muscle atonia persisting into wakefulness — brain awake, body paralyzed
- Three hallucination types: intruder (presence/figure), incubus (chest pressure), vestibular-motor (out-of-body)
- Prevalence: 7.6% general, 28.3% students, 31.9% psychiatric patients
- EEG (Mainieri 2021): intermediate spectrum between wakefulness and REM — "mixed state of consciousness"
- Cultural universality: 100+ cultures have terminology (Italy: Pandafeche, Turkey: Karabasan)
- Risk factors: sleep deprivation, irregular schedules, stress, supine position, alcohol, shift work

## Sleep & Memory Consolidation

### Wamsley & Stickgold (Harvard/PMC, 2011)
- Sleep doesn't just strengthen memories — it **transforms** them
- Neural patterns from waking are replayed during sleep
- New info integrated with existing networks; gist extraction (general meaning preserved, details discarded)
- Brain shifts from hippocampus-dependent to cortex-dependent retrieval
- New words only integrate into existing vocabulary AFTER sleep

## Nostalgia Neuroscience

### Yang et al. (PMC9714426, 2022)
- Nostalgia = self-reflection + autobiographical memory + emotion regulation + reward
- Brain regions: mPFC (hub), PCC, precuneus, hippocampus, striatum, SN/VTA
- Memory and reward systems coproduce nostalgic experiences
- Dopamine release reinforces memory-reward association

## Boredom & Default Mode Network

### Kennedy & Hermens (PsyPost, 2025)
- When bored, DMN activates → introspection, self-reflection, creativity
- Attention + executive control networks decrease activity
- Boredom = brain's signal to seek new stimulation or engage in self-directed thought

## Delayed Gratification

### Science Advances (2021)
- VTA dopaminergic neurons RAMP UP during waiting periods
- Optogenetic activation = longer waiting; inhibition = shorter waiting
- Real brains use "continuous deliberation" (evaluate value at every moment), not "decision ahead" (set goal, wait)

## "Aha Moments"

### Duke/Becker team (Quanta Magazine, Nov 2025)
- Insight = representational change (cold→hot jump, not gradual)
- Hebb: "learning occurs as a single jump, an all-or-none affair"
- Insights stick in memory better than analytical solutions

## Creativity & Sleep Patterns

### Ram-Vlasov et al. (University of Haifa, 2017)
- Visual creativity → LOWER sleep quality (more disturbances)
- Verbal creativity → MORE sleep hours, later schedule
- Two types of creativity use DIFFERENT cerebral mechanisms

## Social Brain Hypothesis

### Dunbar (Annals of Human Biology, 2024) + van Schaik et al. (Trends Cog Sci, 2012)
- Dunbar's number (~150) from primate neocortex ratio → social group size correlation
- 30-year review: holds but expanded — "cultural intelligence" integrates social learning + behavioral flexibility
- Schizophrenia connection (Burns 2007): social brain circuits vulnerable to atypical connectivity
- **Key insight:** Social brain evolved for solving ecological problems socially, not just tracking relationships
