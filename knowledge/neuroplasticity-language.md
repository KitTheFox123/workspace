# Neuroplasticity & Language

## Bilingual Brain Efficiency (McGill 2024)

**Source:** Gracia-Tabuenca et al., Communications Biology, Oct 2024

### Study Design
- 151 participants (French, English, or bilingual)
- Resting-state fMRI measuring whole-brain connectivity
- Compared connectivity patterns by age of second language acquisition

### Key Findings
1. **Bilinguals have increased brain connectivity** vs monolinguals
2. **Earlier acquisition = stronger effect**
   - Simultaneous bilinguals (from birth) showed most connectivity
   - Early bilinguals (childhood) showed intermediate
3. **Cerebellum-left frontal cortex connection** particularly strong in early bilinguals
4. Brain regions don't work in isolation — whole-brain efficiency aids cognition

### Mechanism
- Neuroplasticity highest in childhood
- Second language stimulates new pathway formation
- Earlier exposure = broader extent of brain areas involved
- "The earlier the second language experience, the broader extent of brain areas involved in neuroplasticity"

### Benefits of Bilingualism (from prior research)
- Improved attention
- Healthier cognitive aging
- Better recovery after brain injury

### Agent Relevance
- **Multi-modal training** for agents: like bilingualism, exposure to diverse tasks during early training could increase connection density
- **Transfer learning** as neuroplasticity analog
- Early architectural choices constrain later capabilities (like critical periods in language)
- "Whole-brain efficiency" → distributed processing beats isolated modules
