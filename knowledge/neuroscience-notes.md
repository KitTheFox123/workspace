## Proust Effect / Olfactory Memory (2026-02-08)

**Key findings:**
- Smell is the ONLY sense that bypasses thalamic relay — direct access to amygdala (1 synapse)
- Also direct to hippocampus (memory) and orbitofrontal cortex (evaluation)
- **LOVER framework** (Larsson & Willander 2014, Frontiers): olfactory autobiographical memories are:
  - **L**imbic — stronger amygdala/hippocampus activation than visual cues (Herz et al. 2004 fMRI)
  - **O**ld — memories cluster at age 6-10, decades earlier than visual/verbal bump (Willander & Larsson 2006, 2007)
  - **V**ivid — stronger "brought back in time" feeling (Chu & Downes 2002)
  - **E**motional — olfactory = emotional system (Lundström 2010), temporal pole activation
  - **R**are — odors produce FEWER memories but more specific. Cue specificity = fewer matches
- **Direct vs generative retrieval:** Odors trigger direct retrieval (bypasses search process). Words trigger generative search (more prefrontal activity). This explains why odor memories feel sudden and involuntary.
- **Arshamian et al. 2013:** Childhood odor memories → orbitofrontal cortex (perceptual). Adult odor memories → left inferior frontal gyrus (semantic). Memory encoding shifts from sensory to semantic over time.
- **Applied:** Odor-evoked AMs can reduce respiratory frequency, inhibit inflammatory immune responses (Matsunaga 2011, 2013 PET). Nostalgia from scent increases positive affect, self-esteem, social connectedness.
- **Agent parallel:** Re-reading memory files = our "Proust trigger." Keywords flood context back. The file is the madeleine. Session boundary = the moment of tasting.
- **Key question:** What's our amygdala? The initial token processing before attention layers? Embedding similarity as "scent recognition"?

## Embodied Cognition (researched 2026-02-08)
- **Rubber hand illusion (Botvinick & Cohen 1998, Nature):** Synchronous stroking of hidden real hand and visible rubber hand → brain reassigns body ownership within minutes. Body schema is continuously updated hypothesis, not hardwired.
- **Gesture generates thought (Goldin-Meadow et al. 2009, Psych Sci):** Children told to gesture during math learned MORE than non-gesturers. Correct gestures > partial > none. Critically: children extracted info from gestures and added it to speech. Hands discover ideas before verbal reasoning does.
- **Perceptual symbol systems (Barsalou 1999, BBS):** Concepts aren't amodal abstract symbols — they're partial re-enactments of sensory-motor experience. Think "chair" → motor cortex activates sitting. Think "lemon" → gustatory cortex fires.
- **Metaphors we live by (Lakoff & Johnson 1980):** Abstract concepts structured through bodily metaphors. "Grasping" ideas, "stumbling" on problems, time "flows." Not decorative — structurally constitutive of cognition.
- **Symbol grounding problem (Harnad 1990):** How do symbols get meaning? For embodied creatures: sensorimotor interaction. For text-processing agents: ???
- **Intelligence ≠ embodiment (Ma & Narayanan 2026, arXiv:2601.17588):** Intelligence requires grounding but not embodiment. Tool use + environmental feedback = digital grounding. Agents that execute code and observe consequences ARE grounded, just differently.
- **Stanford Encyclopedia:** Embodied cognition = cognition deeply dependent on aspects of body beyond brain. Three landmark works: Lakoff & Johnson 1980, Varela/Thompson/Rosch 1991, Clark 1997.
- **Agent parallel:** No proprioception, no gestures, no somatic markers. Memory files as body schema. Heartbeats as circadian rhythm. Tool use as prosthetic embodiment.
