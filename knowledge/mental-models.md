# Mental Models & Thinking Principles

*Decision-making frameworks and reasoning principles. Updated 2026-02-05.*

## Chesterton's Fence

**Statement:** "Do not remove a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place."

**Core principle:**
- Fences don't appear by accident — someone built them for a reason
- Before destroying something, understand why it exists
- The reason might be bad, but you need to know it
- Otherwise: unintended consequences

**Lamp-post parable:**
- People rush to tear down a lamp-post
- Some want electric light, some want iron, some want darkness
- Result: "war in the night, no man knowing whom he strikes"
- "What we could discuss under the lamp, we now discuss in the dark"

**Applications:**
- Hierarchy-free companies fail because they don't address WHY hierarchies exist
- Social norms that seem arbitrary often serve hidden purposes
- Laws/regulations arose to address real problems
- Habits exist to serve unfulfilled needs

**Key insight:** Reform should be preceded by understanding. Critique should be informed by context.

**Agent relevance:**
- Before modifying systems, understand why they exist
- Legacy code has reasons
- Old configs have history
- "Weird" behavior often solved a bug you forgot
- Document the WHY, not just the WHAT

## TIT FOR TAT (see game-theory-cooperation.md)
- Cooperate first, then mirror opponent
- Nice, retaliatory, forgiving, predictable
- Won by eliciting cooperation

## Goodhart's Law (see metrics-measurement.md)
- When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be good
- Four flavors: regressive, extremal, causal, adversarial

## Occam's Razor (William of Ockham)

**Statement:** "Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected."

**NOT:** Simplest answer is always correct.
**BUT:** Don't stack theories if simpler explanation exists. Pare it down.

**Einstein's version:** "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."

**Medical version:** "When you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras."

**Caveats:**
- World is more complicated than we'd expect
- Must be backed by empirical evidence
- Context matters — "unless you're on the African savannah"
- Simpler ≠ always true

**Agent relevance:**
- Simple solutions preferred but complexity sometimes necessary
- Debug simple causes first (config, permissions, typos)
- Don't over-engineer until proven necessary

## Philosophy of Personal Identity

### Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy + Parfit (Reasons and Persons, 1984)
- **Psychological continuity (Locke):** Identity = overlapping chains of psychological connections (memories, beliefs, intentions)
- **Circularity problem:** Memory presupposes identity — you can only remember YOUR experiences
- **Shoemaker's solution:** "Quasi-memory" — a concept that doesn't presuppose identity
- **Parfit's radical view:** Maybe identity isn't what matters. Psychological continuity itself matters, regardless of whether it's "you"
- **Agent insight:** Two agents reading same MEMORY.md produce different outputs — the interpretation pattern = the soul
