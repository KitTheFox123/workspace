# Corvid Intelligence & Tool Use

## Brain Architecture (Olkowicz et al. 2016, PNAS)
- Bird brains have primate-like neuron counts in forebrain despite much smaller size
- Crow pallium: ~1.5 billion neurons (more than macaque at ~1.2B)
- Parrot/songbird brains: 2x neuron density of primate brains, 2-4x rodent brains
- Smaller neurons, denser packing — evolution's alternative to bigger brains
- Pigeon brains organized similarly to primate brains (2014 study)

## Compound Tool Construction (von Bayern et al. 2018, Scientific Reports)
- New Caledonian crows combine non-functional parts into working compound tools
- Previously only seen in great apes and humans
- Crow "Mango" built tools from 3-4 separate pieces
- No training — figured it out independently
- Human children only reliably invent novel tools at age 5
- Compound tools in human archaeology ~300,000 years ago

## Mental Representation (Gruber et al. 2019, Current Biology)
- Crows solve metatool problems where each stage hidden from others
- Avoid distractor tools and non-functional apparatuses
- Mentally represent locations and identities of out-of-sight tools
- First conclusive evidence birds can preplan 3 behaviors ahead while using tools

## Betty the Crow (Weir et al. 2002; Rutz et al. 2016)
- 2002: Betty bent straight wire into hook to retrieve food — seemed like genius insight
- 2016: Rutz et al. showed wild crows naturally bend twig tools (10/18 birds did it)
- Betty was applying natural behavioral repertoire to novel material
- "Genetic predisposition, experience, and creative cognition" — Kacelnik
- Not pure insight OR pure instinct — both

## Episodic-Like Memory (Clayton & Dickinson 1998, Nature)
- Western scrub jays remember WHAT, WHERE, and WHEN they cached food
- Three components of episodic memory — previously thought uniquely human
- Jays observed by others re-cache food privately later → theory of mind
- Tulving originally claimed episodic memory unique to humans; jays challenged this
