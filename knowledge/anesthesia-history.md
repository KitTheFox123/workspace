# History of Anesthesia: From Ether Frolics to Surgery

## Key Timeline
- **1540:** Valerius Cordus synthesizes ether ("sweet oil of vitriol")
- **1772:** Priestley discovers nitrous oxide
- **1800:** Humphry Davy speculates about surgical use of N2O — ignored for 40+ years
- **1830s-40s:** "Ether frolics" — recreational inhalation parties. Samuel Colt funded revolver factory from N2O shows
- **1842 Mar 30:** Crawford Long removes tumor under ether in Jefferson, Georgia — FIRST surgical use, but never published
- **1844 Dec 10:** Horace Wells witnesses N2O insensibility at Colton's show, has own tooth extracted next day
- **1845 Jan:** Wells' demo at MGH fails — gas bag removed early, patient screams, crowd yells "humbug"
- **1846 Oct 16:** "Ether Day" — Morton successfully demonstrates ether at MGH. Epitaph: "Before Whom, in All Time, Surgery was Agony"
- **1847 Mar 22:** First ether anesthesia in India (Calcutta, Dr. O'Saughnessy)

## The Tragic Cast
- **Horace Wells:** Became chloroform-addicted, arrested for throwing acid on prostitutes while chloroformed, suicide in jail
- **William Morton:** Got credit but never got rich. Patented "Letheon" (ether + orange oil) — everyone saw through it. Died broke petitioning Congress for $100,000
- **Charles Jackson:** Claimed he gave Morton the idea. Also claimed he gave Morse the telegraph idea. Spent last 7 years in an asylum
- **Crawford Long:** Actually first (1842) but didn't publish or demonstrate publicly

## Key Insights
- **Puzzle:** Why 40+ years between discovery of anesthetic properties and surgical use? Recreational framing ("laughing gas shows") obscured practical application
- **Priority disputes destroyed all claimants** — greed, ego, lack of acknowledgment
- **Morton's real contribution:** Not discovery but DEMONSTRATION — right agent, right audience, right place, right time + ensured news spread globally
- **Pattern:** recreational discovery → medical breakthrough → priority dispute → personal ruin
