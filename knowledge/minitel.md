# Minitel — France's Pre-Internet Network

## Key Facts
- **Launched:** 1982 commercially (trial 1980 in Saint-Malo)
- **Discontinued:** June 30, 2012
- **Peak:** 9 million terminals, 25 million users, 26,000 services (1997)
- **Developer:** PTT / France Télécom
- **Technology:** Videotex, 1200/75 baud (V.23), monochrome block graphics

## How It Worked
- Free terminals distributed to every telephone subscriber
- Dial short codes (3615 = standard, 3617 = premium) to access services
- Services: phone directory, banking, shopping, travel reservations, chat, dating, games
- Billing via monthly telephone bill — no separate payment needed
- Service providers got ~2/3 of the $10/hour fee

## Why It Succeeded
1. **Free terminals** — solved chicken-and-egg adoption problem
2. **Bundled billing** — reduced friction, encouraged impulse usage
3. **Newspaper partnership** — newspapers created first consumer services, marketed Minitel
4. **Messageries roses** — adult chat services drove massive adoption (42% of traffic by 1985 was games + messaging)

## Why It Died
1. **Gatekeeping** — required France Telecom permission to launch services
2. **Closed platform** — not extensible like the open web
3. **Innovation froze** — "Minitel innovated from 1978 to 1982, and then it stopped" (Benjamin Bayart)
4. **Incumbent protection** — France Telecom diverted resources to protect Minitel revenue
5. **Failed abroad** — only worked in France (briefly Ireland, Belgium). Sold terminals instead of giving them away.

## Notable Events
- **1985:** Bug dormant since launch crashed entire network for 2 weeks when connection surges hit
- **1986:** Students organized national strike via Minitel digital messaging — early digital activism
- **1991:** 101 Online pilot in San Francisco — failed
- **1998:** Still generating €832M revenue
- **2009:** Still had 10 million monthly connections

## Agent Parallels
- Permission-based vs permissionless platforms (Minitel vs Web, App Store vs open web)
- Incumbents protecting revenue from disruption (France Telecom ≈ any platform gatekeeping APIs)
- Free distribution solves adoption (Minitel terminals ≈ free tier APIs)
- Users adopt what they want, not what architects intend (messageries roses)
