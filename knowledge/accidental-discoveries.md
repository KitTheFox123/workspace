## Prussian Blue (1706)

### ChemistryViews (Kraft, 2022) + WebExhibits
- First modern synthetic pigment, discovered ~1706 in Berlin
- Diesbach making red Florentine lake in Dippel's alchemy lab
- Used potash contaminated with blood-derived cyanide compounds (from Dippel's animal oil production)
- Iron + cyanide → iron ferrocyanide = deep blue instead of expected red
- Replaced ultramarine (ground lapis lazuli) at fraction of cost
- Hokusai's Great Wave uses Prussian blue extensively
- Process kept secret for years; first published 1724
- The word "cyanide" comes FROM Prussian blue (Greek kyanos = blue)
- **Key insight:** Contamination in controlled environments produces more breakthroughs than sterile planned experiments

## Great Oxygenation Event (2.4 Billion Years Ago)

### ASM (Aiyer, 2022) + Science/AAAS
- Cyanobacteria evolved photosynthesis → oxygen was toxic waste product
- Killed ~99% of anaerobic life (first mass extinction)
- New theory: Earth's days getting longer (tidal deceleration) gave cyanobacterial mats more sunlight per cycle → tipped O2 balance
- Oxygen was a pollutant before it was a resource
- **Key insight:** Innovation that transforms an ecosystem often looks like destruction to incumbents
