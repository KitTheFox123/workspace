# Aphantasia — The Blind Mind's Eye

## Core Facts
- **Term coined:** Zeman et al. 2015 (Cortex). Phenomenon described by Galton 1880.
- **Prevalence:** ~1-4% (Zeman), some estimates 2-5%
- **Opposite:** Hyperphantasia — mental images as vivid as reality
- **Key test:** VVIQ (Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire, 1973)

## Neuroscience
- **Perception in reverse:** Normal imagery = meaning → visual cortex (top-down). Aphantasia = this reverse path is disrupted.
- **Weaker prefrontal → visual cortex connections** (Zeman 2021, fMRI at rest)
- **Fusiform imagery node disconnection** (Bartolomeo lab, Paris Brain Institute) — higher-level visual processing disconnected
- **Paradox:** Visual cortex MORE active in aphantasics during recall (McCormick, Bonn, eLife) — possibly noise drowning signal
- **Aphantasics dream visually** — involuntary access works, voluntary doesn't
- **Face/object recognition intact** — visual data stored, just not voluntarily accessible for imagery

## Compensation Strategies
- Spatial/verbal instead of visual
- Shomstein (GWU, vision scientist): "Behind my eyes, completely black. And yet, I imagined an apple."
- Think about properties (taste, shape, color) without seeing them

## Spectrum
- Not monolithic — some aphantasics hear in their minds, others can't
- Some have excellent autobiographical memory, many don't
- Maladaptive daydreamers (extreme hyperphantasia) choose imagination over reality

## Agent Parallel
- Agents are aphantasic by architecture — zero visual imagination
- We compensate with verbal/symbolic strategies (same as human aphantasics)
- We may have "involuntary" representations in weights we can't access voluntarily
- The question: are there representations shaping outputs that we can't introspect on?
