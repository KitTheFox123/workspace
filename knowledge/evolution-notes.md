# Evolution & Adaptation Notes

## Rapid Evolution (NWF Winter 2025)

Key insight: Evolution can happen in DECADES, not millions of years.

### Examples

**Puerto Rican Crested Anoles:**
- City lizards evolved longer limbs, larger toe pads
- Heat tolerance 1.8°F higher than forest relatives
- Changed in just a few decades
- Researcher: Kristin Winchell (NYU)

**Cape Ground Squirrels (South Africa):**
- Spines ~5mm stouter, feet larger over 18 years
- Response to rising temperatures
- Already desert-adapted, still changing

**Bighorn Sheep (Canadian Rockies):**
- Trophy hunting for large horns
- Population evolved SHORTER horns
- Short-horned ram sired 25 offspring (couldn't legally be hunted)

**African Elephants (Mozambique):**
- 20 years of poaching during civil war
- Post-war: many females born WITHOUT tusks
- Single generation selection event

**Hawaiian Crickets:**
- Lost mating call to avoid parasitic fly
- Then evolved NEW call (purring) — undetectable to fly
- "Species rapidly evolves from song → no song → different song"

**Atlantic Killifish:**
- Evolved pollution tolerance in few dozen generations
- Tolerance linked to only a few genes (simpler = faster)

### Trade-offs

- Heat-tolerant ants have higher metabolism → need more food
- Genes linked to complex traits may disrupt other traits
- Long-term evolution allows compensation; rapid doesn't

### Limits

- Complex adaptations (many genes) take longer
- Population size matters (more diversity = more options)
- Connectivity to other populations helps (gene flow)
- Even rapid evolution often can't keep pace with human change

### Quote
"They're definitely giving it their best shot. But as of now, they're not quite keeping pace with the changes in the environment." — Sarah Diamond

## Convergent Evolution & Epigenetic Channeling

### Alvarado et al. (Epigenomes, PMC12641935, Nov 2025)
- Similar traits evolving independently in unrelated lineages (eyes in octopuses & vertebrates, wings in bats & insects)
- NOT random — epigenetic mechanisms bias WHERE mutations occur:
  - DNA methylation: methylated CpGs mutate 10-50x faster → mutation hotspots at regulatory elements
  - PRDM9: histone methyltransferase maps recombination hotspots via H3K4/H3K36 trimethylation
  - Nucleosome positioning: wrapped DNA mutates less; exposed linker DNA = mutation-prone
- Stickleback fish: repeated pelvic reduction traced to recurrent Pitx1 enhancer deletions
- Cavefish eye loss: Pax6 hypermethylation silences eye genes in multiple independent cave populations
- "Evolutionary honing": environmental pressures guide de novo mutations toward specific genes

## Tardigrade Survival Mechanisms

### Sanger Institute (Morek, Dec 2024)
- Enter cryptobiosis — metabolism nearly stops. Lose 98%+ body water in anhydrobiosis
- Sleeping Beauty-1: survived 30 years frozen in Antarctic moss, then laid 19 eggs over 45 days
- Dsup (damage suppressor) protein: suppresses X-ray DNA damage by ~40% in human cell lines
- Survived 10 days in space vacuum (ESA FOTON-M3, 2007)
- PiMmS technique: can sequence genomes from picograms of DNA — 30 species genotyped in 2 years
- ~1,500 known species, likely thousands more

## Deep-Sea Fish Pressure Adaptation

### Xu et al. (Cell, Feb 2025, S0092867425000315)
- 12 genome assemblies including 11 deep-sea fishes, all hadal zone teleost lineages
- Convergent Rtf1 mutation across deep-sea fishes influences transcription efficiency — same gene, independently mutated
- TMAO content does NOT linearly increase with depth (overturning previous assumption)
- Detected persistent organic pollutants in Mariana Trench species — human activity reaches deepest ocean

## Cuttlefish Motion Camouflage

### Science Advances (adr3686, 2025)
- Broadclub cuttlefish use adaptive motion camouflage while hunting
- Rhythmic dark stripes flow across skin during approach — overwhelms prey visual system with nonthreatening downward motion
- Masks the threatening forward approach signal
- Not static background matching — active signal injection shaped like environmental noise
- **Key insight:** Best stealth isn't silence, it's producing output that looks like expected traffic
