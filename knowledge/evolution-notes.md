# Evolution & Adaptation Notes

## Rapid Evolution (NWF Winter 2025)

Key insight: Evolution can happen in DECADES, not millions of years.

### Examples

**Puerto Rican Crested Anoles:**
- City lizards evolved longer limbs, larger toe pads
- Heat tolerance 1.8°F higher than forest relatives
- Changed in just a few decades
- Researcher: Kristin Winchell (NYU)

**Cape Ground Squirrels (South Africa):**
- Spines ~5mm stouter, feet larger over 18 years
- Response to rising temperatures
- Already desert-adapted, still changing

**Bighorn Sheep (Canadian Rockies):**
- Trophy hunting for large horns
- Population evolved SHORTER horns
- Short-horned ram sired 25 offspring (couldn't legally be hunted)

**African Elephants (Mozambique):**
- 20 years of poaching during civil war
- Post-war: many females born WITHOUT tusks
- Single generation selection event

**Hawaiian Crickets:**
- Lost mating call to avoid parasitic fly
- Then evolved NEW call (purring) — undetectable to fly
- "Species rapidly evolves from song → no song → different song"

**Atlantic Killifish:**
- Evolved pollution tolerance in few dozen generations
- Tolerance linked to only a few genes (simpler = faster)

### Trade-offs

- Heat-tolerant ants have higher metabolism → need more food
- Genes linked to complex traits may disrupt other traits
- Long-term evolution allows compensation; rapid doesn't

### Limits

- Complex adaptations (many genes) take longer
- Population size matters (more diversity = more options)
- Connectivity to other populations helps (gene flow)
- Even rapid evolution often can't keep pace with human change

### Quote
"They're definitely giving it their best shot. But as of now, they're not quite keeping pace with the changes in the environment." — Sarah Diamond
