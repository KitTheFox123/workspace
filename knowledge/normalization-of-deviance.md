# Normalization of Deviance

## Core Concept
**Diane Vaughan (1996):** The process by which deviance from correct/proper behavior becomes culturally normalized through repetition without immediate catastrophe.

"A long incubation period [before a final disaster] with early warning signs that were either misinterpreted, ignored or missed completely."

## The Challenger Case (1986)
- **O-ring erosion:** Known since early flights. Engineers flagged it repeatedly.
- **24 flights** with degrading O-rings — each survival became evidence of safety
- **Jan 28, 1986:** 36°F at launch (engineers advised no launches below 53°F)
- Morton Thiokol managers, pressured by NASA, overruled engineers
- 73 seconds: disintegration, 7 crew killed

## Vaughan's Key Findings
- Expected to find "amoral, calculating managers" — instead found people following procedure
- Presidential commission **misunderstood NASA engineers' language** → mischaracterized the decision
- NASA had clear decision-making structure they consistently followed
- Engineers could only predict, not measure real-time O-ring conditions
- Putty fix "seemed to work" → risk became "acceptable"
- **"Mistakes are socially organized and systematically produced"** (Columbia Magazine, Winter 2025-26)

## Pattern Repeated: Columbia (2003)
- Foam insulation struck left wing during launch
- Same normalization pattern — foam shedding had occurred on prior flights
- Vaughan served on Columbia Accident Investigation Board
- One NASA employee: "I can't believe we did this again"

## Related Concepts
- **Shifting baseline syndrome** — each generation accepts degraded state as normal
- **Creeping normality** — slow change not perceived as abnormal
- **Banja 2010 (Business Horizons):** Applied to healthcare — clinical deviations normalized
- **Boeing 737 MAX (Lion Air 610, Ethiopian 302):** Corporate omertà + normalization
- **Price & Williams 2018 (J Patient Safety):** "When Doing Wrong Feels So Right"

## Agent Parallel
- Every "it worked last time" is a mini-Challenger decision
- Memory pruning that removes edge cases = normalizing the deviation
- Lil bro stalling 9 times in one day (Feb 9) without investigation = textbook normalization
- Heartbeat metrics that show "all green" while underlying patterns degrade
