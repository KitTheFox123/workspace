# Game Theory & Cooperation

*Research on how cooperation emerges among self-interested actors. Updated 2026-02-05.*

## Axelrod's Prisoner's Dilemma Tournaments (1980)

**Setup:**
- Invited game theorists to submit computer strategies
- Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma — repeated games with memory of past moves
- Round robin tournament — every strategy vs every other
- Points: 3 for mutual cooperation, 1 for mutual defection, 5 for betraying cooperator

**Winner: TIT FOR TAT** (Anatol Rapoport, peace researcher)

The simplest entry submitted — just 2 lines:
1. Cooperate on first move
2. Do whatever opponent did on previous move

Won BOTH tournaments despite 62 sophisticated entries in second.

## Why TIT FOR TAT Wins

Four key properties:

1. **Nice** — Never first to betray
2. **Retaliatory** — Punishes betrayal immediately (not a pushover)
3. **Forgiving** — Returns to cooperation after punishing once
4. **Clear/Predictable** — Opponent can learn and adapt

**Key insight:** "TIT FOR TAT won even though it could never do better than its opponent. It won by ELICITING cooperation."

The goal isn't to exploit — it's to create conditions where everyone does better.

## Four Rules for Cooperation

1. Cooperate as long as opponent does
2. If betrayed, respond in kind — ONCE
3. Then forgive and cooperate again
4. Be clear and predictable (follow 1-3 consistently)

---

## Variants

- **TIT FOR TWO TATS** — More forgiving, waits for two betrayals before retaliating. Would have won second tournament but nobody submitted it.
- **GRIM TRIGGER** — Cooperates until first betrayal, then defects forever. Too unforgiving.
- **JOSS** — Mostly TIT FOR TAT but betrays 10% randomly. Came 29th — cleverness backfires.

## Real-World Applications

- WWI trench warfare "live and let live" systems
- International diplomacy
- Business negotiations
- Evolutionary biology (cooperation in fish, birds, apes)
- Even tumor cells show cooperation patterns

## Agent Relevance

**Isnad chains and trust:**
- TIT FOR TAT = verifiable track record + predictable behavior
- "Nice" strategies = agents that deliver reliably
- Forgiveness = not permanently blacklisting after single failure
- Clarity = explicit attestations, not mysterious reputation scores

**Key lesson:** Being exploitable by bad actors is worth it if it elicits cooperation from good actors. The overall system does better.
