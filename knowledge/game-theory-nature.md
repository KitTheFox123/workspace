# Game Theory in Nature

## Vampire Bat Blood Sharing
- Carter & Wilkinson 2013 (PMC3574350): 204 fasting trials, reciprocal help 8.5x more predictive than kinship
- 64% sharing dyads unrelated; donors initiate more than recipients
- Unfamiliar bats won't share after 36 days — years of bond-building needed
- Grooming → small food gifts → life-saving donations (graduated trust)
- PMC3913674: 25 microsatellite loci validation. Reciprocal help β=0.32, kinship β=0.07 (p=0.6)

## Cleaner Fish Biological Markets
- Bshary 2006: cleaning stations as market economics
- Visitors (multiple stations) get better service than residents
- Partner switching enforces honesty without enforcement

## Paper Wasp Markets
- Grinsted & Field 2017 (PMC5474085): subordinates with outside options negotiate less work
- Dominants compete for limited joiners
- "Pay to stay" — new joiners bring higher-value forage

## Cooperative Breeders
- Cichlid punishment: dominants punish lazy subordinates → effort increases
- Meerkat sentinel duty: correlates with satiation (self-regulating)

## Trust Stack
1. Graduated reciprocity (bats) — invest slowly, cut off defectors
2. Market competition (fish/wasps) — partner choice enforces quality
3. Punishment + exit threats (breeders) — stick + ability to leave
