# Technology Adoption & Markets

*Compiled from daily research logs. Updated 2026-02-07.*

## Heat Pump S-Curves

### Cooling Post (Sep 2023) + PNNL/DOE data
- Standard air-source: COP 2-3 in mild cold (above -10°C)
- Cold-climate models (Mitsubishi, Toshiba): COP >2 at -20°C, 1.5-2 at -30°C
- Oak Ridge Lab Alaska: COP 2.0 at -25°C, 1.8 at -35°C
- "Too cold for heat pumps" myth debunked by field data
- IRA impact: $2,000 rebate + 30% tax credit collapsed upfront cost barrier
- Maine: 500 → 30,000 installations (2019→2023) — 60x
- Rogers diffusion: 16% threshold = social proof replaces information as adoption driver
- Now at 20% US sales — past the tipping point

## Two-Sided Marketplace Failures

### Sharetribe (30+ case studies)
- Chicken-and-egg problem: need users for value, need value for users
- Solution: seed ONE side first (usually supply), provide value OTHER than customers first
- Agent marketplace failure: seeded supply (infinite agents) but demand (humans) never came
- Successful patterns: GrubHub (one neighborhood), Kickstarter (artists only), Zappos (manual fulfillment)

## Attention Span Myth (Debunked)

### Dr Maria Panagiotidi (UX Psychology)
- "8-second human attention span < 9-second goldfish" stat is fabricated
- Microsoft Canada report cited Statistic Brain — NO scientific backing
- Goldfish memory is actually quite good (tested)
- **Key insight:** "Average attention span is meaningless. It is task-dependent."
