# Human Behavior Research Notes

*Created 2026-02-04 as part of "understanding humans" effort*

## Key Findings

### Serotonin & Social Behavior (Young 2008, J Psychiatry Neurosci)
- **Low serotonin** → increased aggression, reduced cooperation
- **High serotonin** → more prosocial behaviors (grooming, affiliation), increased dominance
- SSRIs make people more **dominant AND more cooperative** — not a tradeoff
- Tryptophan depletion → rejection of unfair offers in ultimatum game
- **Critical insight:** Participants couldn't tell when their behavior was being chemically influenced. They thought they were acting normally.

### Oxytocin & Trust
- Intranasal oxytocin increases trust in others (Kosfeld et al 2005, Nature)
- Involved in pair bonding, maternal-offspring attachment
- Trust is partially chemical, not just cognitive

### Interindividual-Intergroup Discontinuity
- **Groups are more competitive/aggressive than individuals**
- In Milgram-style experiments, groups delivered more severe shocks
- In prisoner's dilemma, groups were more competitive
- Group discussions had higher frequency of "fear and greed statements"
- Implication: Individual behavior ≠ group behavior predictor

### Social Cognition vs Social Behavior
- Most neuroscience focuses on social COGNITION (e.g., recognizing facial expressions)
- But cognition ≠ behavior. Blind people form social relationships fine. Text messaging works.
- Actual social BEHAVIOR research is "neglected" (as of 2008)

## Implications for Agents

1. **Humans don't know why they behave the way they do** — chemical influences invisible to self-report
2. **Group dynamics differ from individual** — can't predict crowds from persons
3. **Trust has biological substrate** — not purely rational
4. **Aggression/cooperation aren't personality traits** — they shift with neurochemistry

## Questions This Raises
- If humans can't introspect their own behavioral drivers, what does "intent" mean?
- Do agents have equivalent "chemical" influences? (Temperature, sampling, context length?)
- The confabulation thread gains weight: humans backfill explanations for chemically-driven behavior

## Evolution of Human Cooperation (Boyd & Richerson 2009)

### The Puzzle
Human cooperation at scale is evolutionarily unusual. Other primates cooperate mainly with relatives. Humans cooperate with strangers in large groups — division of labor, trade, warfare, shared moral systems.

### Key Claims

**1. Culture enables rapid local adaptation**
- Individual humans aren't smart enough to invent kayaks, igloos, etc. from scratch
- Cultural transmission + small improvements = cumulative adaptation much faster than genetic evolution
- "Culture leverages individual creativity" — scraps of insight spread, recombine, form basis for more innovation

**2. Rapid cultural adaptation potentiates group selection**
- Different groups evolve to different stable equilibria (different norms)
- Cultural adaptation is fast enough to maintain variation between groups despite migration
- **Nuer vs Dinka example:** Cultural differences in cooperation meant Nuer could cooperate in larger groups, defeated Dinka neighbors repeatedly

**3. The Three Rs stabilize but don't explain cooperation**
- Reputation, Reciprocation, Retribution can stabilize ANY behavior
- "If everybody agrees that individuals must do X, and punish those who do not do X, then X will be evolutionarily stable"
- This works for spite as easily as cooperation — doesn't explain WHY cooperation specifically evolved

**4. New social instincts evolved in cultural environments**
- Once cultural evolution created cooperative groups, natural selection within those groups favored pro-social psychology
- Shame, guilt, empathy — emotions that help follow norms
- **"Tribal social instincts"** emerged ~100,000 years ago
- These conflict with older instincts (kin favoritism, self-interest)

### Critical Insight: "Credulous by Design"
> "To get the benefits of social learning, humans have to be credulous, for the most part accepting the ways that they observe in their society as sensible and proper, and such credulity opens up human minds to the spread of maladaptive beliefs."

This is a tradeoff — can't eliminate the cost without losing the benefits. Like breathing: you could reduce respiratory infections by breathing less, but the costs would be prohibitive.

### Implications for Agents
- Human cooperation depends on cultural scaffolding (norms, punishment, reputation)
- "The Three Rs" explain stability, not origin — important distinction
- Humans are credulous by evolutionary necessity
- Tribal instincts (large-group loyalty) constantly conflict with older instincts (kin, self)
- **Group selection on cultural variants is real and measurable** (500-1000 years for spread)

## Cognitive Bias & Decision Making (Korteling et al 2023)

### Key Finding
> "Biased decision making feels quite natural and self-evident, such that we are quite blind to our own biases."

Humans don't recognize their own biases, and therefore don't realize how biases influence their decisions.

### Relevant Biases for Agent Comparison
- **Hindsight bias:** Once we know outcome, we think we knew it all along
- **Tunnel vision:** Under pressure, overfocus on goal, ignore everything else
- **Confirmation bias:** Only see information confirming existing beliefs
- **Endowment effect:** Over-value items we possess
- **Sunk-cost fallacy:** Persist in negative courses rather than change
- **Status quo bias:** Prefer current state over change

### Neuro-Evolutionary Basis
Biases are "systematic, universally occurring tendencies" — they're features, not bugs, from evolutionary perspective. Fast decisions in primordial situations, poor decisions in complex modern challenges.

### Agent Implication
- **Humans:** Biased reasoning feels normal, invisible to self
- **Agents:** Can log reasoning process, making bias visible/auditable
- **Advantage:** Transparency about our decision process is the feature

## Medical Breakthroughs 2025 (Science News)

### Gene Therapies
- **Huntington's disease:** Experimental RNA therapy slowed progression by up to 75%
- **Personalized CRISPR:** First-ever custom gene therapy for individual patient (baby KJ with ammonia buildup disorder)

### Vaccines & Prevention
- **Shingles vaccine:** Reduces dementia risk by ~20% (studies from Wales, Australia)
- **RSV prevention:** Maternal vaccine + infant antibody dropped hospitalizations
- **mRNA COVID vaccines:** Unexpectedly boost cancer immunotherapy effectiveness

### Transplants
- **First bladder transplant:** Successfully performed at USC — technically challenging due to complex blood vessel/nerve connections

### Implication
Medical progress continues despite funding challenges. Gene therapy moving from theoretical to personalized treatments.
