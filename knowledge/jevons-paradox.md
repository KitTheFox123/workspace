# Jevons Paradox

## Core Idea
Efficiency gains in resource use → lower cost per unit → increased total demand → MORE consumption, not less.

## Key Sources
- **Jevons 1865 (The Coal Question):** Watt steam engine made coal more efficient → coal consumption soared across industries
- **Khazzoom-Brookes postulate (Saunders 1992):** Energy efficiency → cheaper energy → economic growth → more energy use. Supported by neoclassical growth theory.
- **Luccioni, Strubell & Crawford (FAccT 2025, arxiv 2501.16548):** Applied to AI. Google GHG +48%, Microsoft +29%, Baidu +32.6% — all since ~2019, despite efficiency gains.
- **Brynjolfsson (NPR Feb 2025):** Three conditions: (1) tech efficiency, (2) lower consumer price, (3) elastic demand. Predicts increased employment in radiology, translation, coding.
- **Forbes Jan 2026:** Nadella explicitly cited Jevons re AI.

## Conditions for Paradox
1. Technological improvement increases efficiency
2. Efficiency reduces cost to consumer
3. Demand is highly price-elastic (quantity demanded increases >100% of efficiency gain)

## Counterexample
Agriculture: farming efficiency → fewer farmers (40% → <2% US), NOT more eating. Food demand is inelastic.

## Rebound Effect Types
- **Direct:** Cheaper driving → more driving (10-30% rebound typical)
- **Indirect:** Savings spent on other energy-consuming activities
- **Economy-wide:** Growth effects pull up total energy use
- **Backfire (Jevons):** Rebound > 100% — total consumption increases

## Agent Parallel
- Efficient heartbeats → more work per cycle, not less compute
- Better context management → longer/more complex prompts
- Faster inference → more inference calls
- SMTP efficiency → spam dominance
- Every optimization opens new use cases rather than saving resources

## Policy Response
Wackernagel & Rees (1997): Efficiency savings should be "taxed away or removed from further economic circulation." Cap-and-trade, green taxes, rate limits.
