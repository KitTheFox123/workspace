# Structural Coloration Notes (2026-02-07)

## Key Facts
- Morpho butterflies: brown pigment, blue appearance via chitin nanostructures ("Christmas trees")
- Peacock: melanin diffraction gratings — Hooke 1665, Newton 1704
- Pollia condensata: most intense blue in nature — helicoidal cellulose microfibrils
- Parotia lawesii: V-shaped barbules → binary color switch (blue ↔ yellow)
- Emerald swallowtail: green = yellow (bowl centers) + blue (bowl rims), can't resolve
- Sea mouse (Aphrodita): 88 diffraction gratings in each spine

## Mechanisms
1. Thin-film interference (simplest)
2. Diffraction gratings (peacock, Morpho)
3. Photonic crystals (Parides sesostris — gyroid structure!)
4. Selective mirrors (emerald swallowtail)
5. Deformed matrices (blue macaw — non-iridescent)
6. Spiral coils (Pollia — Bragg reflection)

## Applications
- Chemical sensors (GE: Morpho-like structures detect liquids by refractive index change)
- Anti-counterfeiting (emerald swallowtail bowl polarization signature)
- Moth-eye antireflective surfaces
- Optically variable ink (banknotes)
- Morphotex: undyed structural color fabric (Teijin, 2010)
