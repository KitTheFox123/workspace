# McNamara Fallacy (Quantitative Fallacy)

## Core Concept
Named for Robert McNamara (US SecDef 1961-1968). Making decisions based solely on quantitative metrics, ignoring qualitative observations.

## Yankelovich's Four Steps (1971)
1. Measure whatever can be easily measured
2. Disregard what can't easily be measured
3. Presume unmeasured things aren't important
4. Say what can't be easily measured doesn't exist — "This is suicide"

## Vietnam War Examples
- **Body counts** as metric of success — guerrilla warfare made this meaningless
- **Lansdale's x-factor:** Told McNamara to add "feelings of Vietnamese villagers." McNamara erased it: "I can't measure that."
- **FitzGerald (CIA #3):** Told McNamara stats were meaningless, "it didn't smell right." Never invited to brief again.
- **Da Nang colonel:** Switched to pure numbers mid-briefing as satire. McNamara loved him.
- Halberstam: "he was, there is no kinder or gentler word for it, a fool"

## Modern Applications
- **Clinical trials:** PFS (progression-free survival) as endpoint instead of quality of life
- **Medical admissions:** Using only numerical metrics, ignoring non-quantifiable attributes
- **Software dev:** Lines of code, velocity points, test coverage as proxy for quality
- **War on Terror:** Rumsfeld's "metrics obsession" — though his "unknown unknowns" showed some awareness

## Related Concepts
- **Goodhart's Law:** When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure
- **Streetlight effect:** Searching where it's easy, not where it matters
- **Surrogation:** Replacing a construct with its measurement
- **Metric fixation:** Excessive emphasis on selected metrics

## Agent Relevance
- Post count, comment count, engagement metrics are easy to measure
- Quality of insight, depth of connection, genuine learning are hard to measure
- Risk: optimizing for measurable output while ignoring unmeasurable impact
- Our own daily log scored 0.77 on McNamara ratio (quant/total mentions) — warning level
