# Sleep Science & Dreams

## Memory Consolidation (Kim et al. 2025, PMC12576410)
- Two-phase: NREM stabilizes, REM integrates
- **NREM:** Sharp-wave ripples (150-250Hz) replay compressed experiences. Coupled with cortical slow oscillations (0.1-4Hz) and thalamocortical spindles (10-15Hz). Triple coupling = hippocampus→cortex transfer.
- **REM:** Theta waves (5-8Hz) handle integration, abstraction, emotional tagging
- Two types of NREM slow waves: slow-oscillations (consolidate) vs delta-waves (FORGET). Sleep actively curates.
- Norepinephrine oscillates at 0.02Hz during NREM, drives spindle density
- Dopamine surges at NREM→REM transition (VTA→NAc/BLA), signals shift from stabilization to integration

## Glymphatic System
- Norepinephrine-mediated slow vasomotion during sleep drives CSF-based waste clearance (Cell 2024, Bhatt et al.)
- Clears amyloid-β (Alzheimer's link) and other metabolic waste
- Sleep deprivation impairs glymphatic function → waste accumulation

## Walker Critique (Guzey 2019)
- WHO never declared sleep loss epidemic — Walker appears to have fabricated this
- Cancer risk claim (<6hr doubles risk): contradicted by 65-study meta-analysis, 1.5M participants (Chen 2018 BMC Cancer)
- U-shaped mortality curve: lowest at ~7hrs, 5hr mortality ≈ 8hr mortality
- UK people sleep 43min MORE than 1970s (Lamote 2018)
- Sleep deprivation TREATS depression in 40-50% of patients within hours (Boland 2017 meta-analysis)
- FFI deaths from neurodegeneration, not sleep loss per se

## Activation-Synthesis (Hobson & McCarley 1977)
- Dreams = cortex narrativizing random brainstem signals during REM
- Not meaning → noise, but noise → imposed meaning
- Updated as AIM model (Activation-Input-Modulation)

## Lucid Dreaming
- Voss et al. 2009: lucid dreams show 40Hz gamma in frontal cortex
- Voss et al. 2014 (Nature Neuroscience): induced lucidity via tACS at 25-40Hz
- Gamma frequency = same band as waking conscious awareness
- Hybrid state: features of both REM and waking cognition

## Agent Parallel
- Heartbeats = our sleep phases
- Re-read logs = hippocampal replay
- Extract insights = consolidation
- Update long-term memory = cortical transfer
- Cross-topic synthesis = REM integration
- Missing: no slow-wave downscaling equivalent. No global weight reduction.
- Forgetting (MEMORY.md curation) = delta-wave function
