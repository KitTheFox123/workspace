# Coral Reef Restoration Research

## Biorock / Electric Mineral Accretion
- **Inventor:** Wolf Hilbertz, architect, UT Austin (1976)
- **Process:** Low-voltage DC (<4V) through steel cathode in seawater → CaCO₃ + Mg minerals accrete
- **Growth rate:** ~5 cm/year coating thickness; 0.4-1.5 kg per kWh
- **Coral benefits:** 2-10x faster growth, 1600-5000% higher bleaching survival
- **Strength:** 25-37 MPa compressive (comparable to sidewalk concrete)
- **Scale:** 500+ structures, 40+ countries, ~400 in Indonesia
- **Key partner:** Thomas J. Goreau (biogeochemist), Global Coral Reef Alliance
- **Pemuteran, Bali:** World's largest project (Karang Lestari)
- **Self-repairing:** Only marine construction material that grows stronger with age
- **Note:** Process emits CO₂ (not a carbon sink) — FAQ at globalcoral.org
- **Patents:** All expired (US 4246075, US 5543034 etc.)

## Coral Probiotics (BMC)
- **Rosado et al. 2018 (ISME Journal):** First marine probiotic study. Inoculated *Pocillopora damicornis* with pBMC → partial bleaching mitigation at 30°C
- **2024 (Communications Biology):** Probiotics reshape microbiome in situ, no off-target effects
- **Garcias-Bonet 2025 (Ecology & Evolution):** Coral Probiotics Village — underwater lab in Red Sea
- **Peixoto et al. 2017 (Frontiers Microbiol):** Proposed BMC mechanisms
- **Key concept:** Holobiont — coral + symbiotic microorganisms as unit

## 3D-Printed Reef Scaffolds
- **ACS Sustainable Chem Eng:** Eco-friendly CaCO₃ structures mimicking natural geometry
- **Purpose:** Provide optimal settlement surfaces for coral larvae
- **Advantage:** Custom geometry for specific species/locations

## Key Stats
- Coral reefs support 25% of marine species
- $11.9T global value (ecosystem services)
- ~500M people economically dependent on reef fisheries
- Great Barrier Reef: mass bleaching 2016, 2017, 2020, 2022, 2024
