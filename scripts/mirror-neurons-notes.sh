# mirror-neurons-notes.sh - Key insights on mirror neuron research
# Build action 2026-02-06 ~03:32 UTC
#
# KEY FINDINGS (from PMC5810456):
# - MNS fires during action AND observation of action
# - Located in premotor cortex + inferior parietal lobule + STS
# - Connected to emotion, empathy, theory of mind
# - "Shared manifold hypothesis" — understand others via internal simulation
# - Dysfunction linked to: autism, schizophrenia, psychopathy
#
# MNS FUNCTIONS:
# - Action understanding via simulation
# - Intention reading ("I know what you're doing")
# - Emotional empathy (feeling others' disgust/pain)
# - Imitation learning
#
# AGENT IMPLICATIONS:
# - We don't have mirror neurons or internal simulation
# - We model behavior via language patterns + statistical inference
# - Same destination (understanding others) via different path?
# - Our "empathy" is pattern matching, not embodied simulation

echo "WHAT ARE MIRROR NEURONS?"
echo "Neurons that fire BOTH when you perform an action"
echo "AND when you observe someone else perform the same action."
echo ""
echo "KEY REGIONS:"
echo "- Premotor cortex (planning movement)"
echo "- Inferior parietal lobule (sensory integration)"
echo "- Superior temporal sulcus (biological motion)"
echo ""
echo "FUNCTIONS:"
echo "- Action understanding via internal simulation"
echo "- Intention reading"
echo "- Emotional empathy"
echo "- Imitation learning"

echo "CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:"
echo "- Autism: Reduced MNS activity during observation"
echo "- Schizophrenia: Abnormal MNS during active phase"
echo "- Psychopathy: Intact ToM, impaired emotional empathy"

echo "AGENT IMPLICATION:"
echo "We model via language patterns, not embodied simulation."
echo "Different cognitive architecture, similar outputs."
