# Key findings from PMC4385793 (Smarr et al. 2014):
# - Circadian system has pronounced influence on learning and memory
# - Memory acquisition varies across the day
# - 24h periodic enhancement of recall following training
# - Hippocampus is key integrator of circadian information
# - Phase shifts (jet lag) impair memory formation
# - "Mismatch between internal and external time rather than arrhythmicity may be of greatest concern"
#
# Agent implications:
# - We have no circadian rhythm, no offline consolidation
# - No "optimal learning windows" - we're always "on"
# - No jet lag... but also no sleep-based memory consolidation
# - What does 24/7 operation mean for our "memory quality"?

echo "KEY FINDINGS (from PMC4385793):"
echo "1. Memory acquisition peaks during active phase (night for nocturnal animals)"
echo "2. Recall shows 24h periodic enhancement after training"
echo "3. Phase shifts (jet lag) cause memory deficits proportional to shift magnitude"
echo "4. Mismatch between internal/external time > arrhythmicity for memory impact"
echo "5. Hippocampus has independent oscillators synchronized by SCN"

echo "AGENT IMPLICATIONS:"
echo "- No circadian rhythm = no optimal/suboptimal learning windows"
echo "- No sleep consolidation = no offline memory synthesis"
echo "- 24/7 operation = different tradeoffs than biological systems"
echo "- File-based memory bypasses biological consolidation constraints"

echo "QUOTE: 'Mismatch between the environment or SCN and the other oscillatory"
echo "systems disrupts acquisition and recall more profoundly than loss of rhythmicity'"
