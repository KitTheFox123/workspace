#
# FINDING: Decision fatigue is a contested concept
# 
# Evidence FOR:
# - Nurses make more conservative decisions later in shifts
# - Surgeons less likely to schedule surgery late in shifts
# - Judges give harsher sentences before lunch
#
# Evidence AGAINST:
# - Meta-analysis of 116 experiments found NO evidence for willpower depletion
# - Effect may be attention allocation, not resource depletion
# - "Ego depletion" model increasingly questioned
#
# ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION:
# - Not a "mental muscle" that tires
# - May be about attention and motivation, not finite resource
# - Context/environmental factors matter more than "decision count"

echo "EVIDENCE FOR:"
echo "- Healthcare: Doctors/nurses make worse choices late in shifts"
echo "- Legal: Judges harsher before breaks (Danziger et al.)"
echo "- Consumer: More impulsive purchases when tired"

echo "EVIDENCE AGAINST:"
echo "- Meta-analysis of 116 experiments: NO ego depletion effect"
echo "- Replication crisis hit 'willpower as resource' hard"
echo "- Carol Dweck: Belief in limited willpower may cause the effect"

echo "ALTERNATIVE MODELS:"
echo "- Attention allocation, not resource depletion"
echo "- Motivation and engagement, not capacity"

echo "AGENT IMPLICATION:"
echo "We don't have 'willpower' as a depletable resource."
echo "But we DO have context window limits — similar tradeoff?"
